Don't overthink this. It is the bright object right in the center of the picture. Those bright objects off to the side are neither part of the galaxy nor the galaxy itself, so do not mark them.\n- Use the Ellipse tool. Click on the center of the galaxy image and draw outward to fit as accurate of an ellipse as possible. \n- Try to set the longer line in the ellipse (the semi-major axis) to the longer side of the galaxy.\n- Make sure the ellipse encloses the entire galaxy, even the fuzz around it.\n- Also, make sure to enclose the galaxy as tightly as possible.\n- NOT ALL GALAXIES ARE PERFECTLY ROUND.  Enclose every part of the galaxy within the ellipse, even if an arm is sticking out.  This is normally the case with spiral galaxies that have distinct, protruding arms."",""value"":[{""x"":468.96875,""y"":476.625,""rx"":32,""ry"":32.01562118716424,""tool"":0,""angle"":-1.7899106082460605,""frame"":0,""details"":[],""tool_label"":""Ellipse""}]}]","{""21796260"":{""retired"":null,""Filename"":""588017721723977832.jpg""}}",21796260
